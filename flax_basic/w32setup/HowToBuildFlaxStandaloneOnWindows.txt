-- Creating the build environment --

1. Make a folder for Flax, say c:\Flax
2. Check out the Flax sources to this folder 
3. Install Python 2.5.1 (to the default folder, C:\Python25) and add this folder to your Path (Control Panel, System, Advanced, Environment  Variables) [NOT Python 2.5, we have found at least one situation where this matters]
4. Install a recent Perl (say 5.8.8 from Active State at http://www.activestate.com/Products/activeperl/) - make a note of the Path to this for config.mak later.
5.a. Install Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition from
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/cc952313.aspx
5.b. Install the Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows 2003 Server R2 from http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=0baf2b35-c656-4969-ace8-e4c0c0716adb&displaylang=en
5.c. Install the .NET SDK 1.1 from http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=9b3a2ca6-3647-4070-9f41-a333c6b9181d
5.d. Run the file 'vc2003.reg' in this folder - this creates some missing registry entries
5.e. Download msvcprt.lib from http://root.cern.ch/root/Procedure/Procedure%20to%20install%20the%20free%20Microsoft%20Visual%20C.htm and put it in 
the folder C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual C++ Toolkit 2003\lib
6. a. Download the Visual C redistributable files from http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=32BC1BEE-A3F9-4C13-9C99-220B62A191EE&displaylang=en
and copy into the same folder as this text file.
b. Download the Windows Installer 3.0 update (WindowsInstaller-KB884016-v2-x86.exe) from http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=5FBC5470-B259-4733-A914-A956122E08E8&displaylang=en
and copy into the same folder as this text file.
7.a. Install pywin32 for Python 2.5
  b. Install py2exe for Python 2.5
        HACK: py2exe currently needs patching:
        http://www.selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial-devel/2006-November/000353.html
8. Install InnoSetup and add its folder to your Path
9. Install Zlib from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/downlinks/zlib.php, choosing a path of \GnuWin32. Extract zlib1.dll from the /bin folder and put it in the same folder as this text file. 
Make a note of the path for putting into config.mak later. You'll also have to patch Zlib as follows: find the file include/zconf.h 
in the Zlib installation folder and change line 289 to:
#  include <safeunistd.h> 
10. Install libiconv from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/downlinks/libiconv.php and install to \GnuWin32  and add the folder to /bin to your Path (i.e. C:\GnuWin32\bin). Copy libiconv.dll from this folder to the same folder as this text file.
11. Install SVN (download and unzip the Windows binary ' svn-win32-1.4.5.zip' from http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=91 and add the folder to /bin to your Path (i.e. c:\work\svn-win32-1.4.5\bin)
12. Get some missing runtime libraries:
a. Run vcredist_x86.exe 
b. Copy msvcr80.dll from C:\WINDOWS\WinSxS\x86_Microsoft.VC80.CRT_1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b_8.0.50727.42_x-ww_0de06acd to C:\Windows, otherwise distutils can't find it.
c. Download msvcp71.dll from http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?msvcp71 - this is something Py2exe needs - unzip into the same folder as this text file.

-- Building Xapian & Flax --

11. To build Xapian and the other Flax dependencies:

[[ a. cd to ..\libs\xappy\libs and run 'python get_xapian.py' to obtain the correct version of Xapian.
b. modify xapian-core\win32\config.mak to match your system (Python path, Perl path, Zlib path)
c. modify xapian-core\win32\win32_bindings_python.mak to comment out lines 70-77 (the block that starts with 'modern/xapian_wrap.cc...'
TEMP: change the first line of win32msvc\version.rc.python to
#include "winresrc.h" ]]

d. run the batch file 'buildalldeps' (if you already have the Xapian bindings built, use the 'nobindings' command line option to skip rebuilding them)
     
12. To build Flax only, run the batch file 'buildflaxonly'
13. The packaged, standalone Flax should be in the package/ subfolder
