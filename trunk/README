Flax
----

Flax is web based search system. See <http://www.flax.co.uk> for more
information.

If you are just interested in running flax on Windows then the easiest
route is to use a prebuilt installer (availble from the web site).

The current version can also be run from the command line on any
platform where the dependecies can be installed. This is known to work
on at least Windows (XP, Server 2003) , linux (ubuntu 7.10 - but any
recent distribution should do) and Mac OS X.

To build a windows installer see
w32setup/HowToBuildFlaxStandaloneOnWindows.txt

To run from the command line first ensure that you have the required
depencies available. We assume in the following that this file is
containing in a directory 'flaxcode/' adjust paths and the this is the
current directory.

Dependencies
------------

Flax depends on Python 2.5, available from http://www.python.org/

Flax also depends on several Python modules which are not part of the
standard distribution.  The easiest way to install these dependencies is
simply to run:

   python utils/install_dependencies.py

This will install the dependencies locally (to a directory "localinst",
which flax looks for when it starts up), so you won't need root or
administrator privileges.

Flax also depends on Xapian and its python bindings; as well as the
processing module, which you currently need to install manually. See
http://www.xapian.org (you will need to use a recent snapshot) and
http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/processing (currently we use the
0.34 release).

If you want to install the dependencies manually, then see the
document flaxcode/src/docs/hacking.rst for a list of the require
packages (or examine utils/install_dependecies to see what it does).

The install_dependecies.py script places versions of these packages in
subdirectory 'localinst' that is added to the python path in the
code. It is not necessary that these packages are in this location,
but they much be importable.


Running from the Command Line
-----------------------------

Change directories to the src/ subdirectory, and then then::

  python startflax.py

On windows, if you have already run the windows installed some path
will be taken from the registry, so if you want to run independently
of the installed version then pass some command line options to
override the registry settings, for example::

  python startflax.py --src-dir=. main-dir=data. conf-dir=.

More information about the command line options can be obtained by running::

  python startflax.py --help

By default the web server will run on port 8090, but you can change
that by editing cp.conf. The server can be terminated by raising
KeyboardInterupt (normally hitting Control-C).

Note that Flax will start some other processes. These should all die
when the main process finishes, in the event of abnormal termination
then it might be that (depending on operating system) that the other
processes are not terminated and will need to be killed manually.

There is more information on the internals of Flax available in
flaxcode/src/hacking.rst.
