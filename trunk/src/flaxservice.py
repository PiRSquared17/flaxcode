# signal.signal).  However, this is not possible when we're installing as a
# service, since signal.signal only works in the main thread, and we are run in
# a subthread by the service handling code.  Therefore, we install a dummy
# signal handler to avoid an exception being thrown.
# Signals are pretty unused on windows anyway, so hopefully this won't cause a
# problem.  If it does cause a problem, we'll have to work out a way to set a
