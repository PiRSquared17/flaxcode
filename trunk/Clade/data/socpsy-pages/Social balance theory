== Development of the Theory ==

This theory evolved over time to produce models more closely resembling real-world social networks. It uses a balance index to measure the effect of local balance on that of a global level and also on a more intimate level, like in interpersonal relationships. Cartwright and Harary introduced "clustering" to account for multiple social cliques. Davis introduced "hierarchal clustering" to account for asymmetric relations. Social balance theory later developed into what is now called "transitivity".
