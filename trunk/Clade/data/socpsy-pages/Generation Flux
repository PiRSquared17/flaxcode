Generation Flux is a neologism and psychographic (not demographic) designation for American employees who need to make several changes in career throughout their working lives due to the chaotic nature of the job market following the 2008â€“2012 global financial crisis. The pace of change has been accelerated by the use of social media, smartphones, mobile computing, and other new technologies.
