The Linderman effect is a direct statistical correlation between the effect of a third party acting on multivariable data versus the mean difference of the standard deviation from known reference values. It is assumed that the linderman effect, acting independently, does not cause noticeable changes to the standard deviation. The Linderman Effect occurs mainly in groups of two or three individuals working within a high stress environment. It has been noted from preliminary tests, that the Linderman Effect mainly occurs in academic fields such as chemistry, biology, and physics. The linderman effect has not yet been studied in other high stress environments such as a rescue worker or a person in the medical profession. 

The Linderman effect was originally studied during the fall of 2009. The study was performed at universities across the upper-midwest of the US. To test the variability of the Linderman effect, two to three students were placed in groups and were assigned laboratory tasks associated with sophomore level science majors. The first test involved the process of making twelve dilutions from 120ppm solutions of acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine. The solutions were then tested using diode-array spectroscopy to determine the exact concentration of each dilution. The second test involved a general physics based laboratory exercise. The students were required to induce a current on a pre-assembled apparatus, and study the relative effects of a varying current and voltage on the relative distance between two wires. The force between wires induced in this experiment was compared to literature values. The third experiment focused on the preparation of diactylferrocene in organic synthesis labs. The preparation requires exact additions of each reagent, and can be considered a high stress organic synthesis for students. The solution obtained from the third experiment was analyzed using IR spectroscopy, and a percent yield was determined. The Linderman effect was introduced to one group in each study. The relative proximity of each group, from the test group was recorded, and their final lab data values were obtained and graphed. 

Results

The relative median score out of 100 possible points for each experiment for the test group was determined to be 68. 100 points came from three main factors, 50 points from the grade the professor provided for the lab, 10 points if the group completed the task within the scheduled time, 10 points if the group obtained reasonable data, 20 points if the group completed with lab with a final value within a +-10% of the median of the class average, and 10 points if the group worked well as a team. Assigning one group as the test group, a relative decrease in the overal accuracy of the lab data was seen. The experimental data also indicated a downward trend in the overall yields of groups within two-three stations away from the test group in each case. The standard deviation for each of the experiments was calculated and compared to the "norm" standard deviation for each of the classrooms. The standard deviation values are listed in table 1. 
The standard deviation values listed in table 1 are the average values obtained for each of the trials. With a sample of 10 trials selected for both the test group and the standard group, it can be assumed that the values obtained by the test group far surpass the values for the standard group. Not pictured here are the values obtained for groups within a general radius of three lab groups. The style of room for test 2 hindered a relative proximity of 15 ft to be relatively clear of all other students, leaving groups with much space. The Linderman effect could only be applied to the individual group's data in comparison to the norm. Table 2 represents the data obtained for 1 group distance (5 ft), 2 distances (10 ft), and 3 distances (15 ft). 

Conclusion

At this time, it is assumed that the Linderman effect can be verifiably induced in a student during a stressful situation, and can cause the relative accuracy and precision of the student's work to decrease. The link between the Linderman effect and irrationality can be closely tied. As the stress level in the working environment increases, the focus of the topic at hand must become primary. If the student is distracted by the idea of a third party, and not necessarily a third party in person, the student is most likely to concentrate less on the data and more on their own personal selves. The possible situations where the Linderman effect has yet to be studied, such as in a test taking scenario, or in a high stress job, need to be studied to examine the full effect of the "third party". Test anxiety and other mental disorders may be linked with and may be associated to the Linderman effect. The full effects of the Linderman effect are still being studied today. This website will be updated with new information as new studies and surveys are completed.
