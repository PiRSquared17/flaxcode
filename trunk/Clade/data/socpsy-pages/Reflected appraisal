In social psychology, the reflected appraisal process is considered one of the influences on the development of self-concept. The term refers to a process where we imagine how other people see us.
For example; if people treat us as the leader of the group, we take on this role by affirming this identity through the means of their appraisals.

Reflected appraisals of self in roles and statuses were studied by comparing respondents who think other people regard their age, sex, race, occupation, marital status, and social class as very important versus those who do not think other people view them primarily in terms of those roles. Data came from a national telephone survey. The study showed that reflected appraisals of self in roles and statuses are negatively related to self-esteem, and this relationship is no stronger for women than for men. In addition, across three different settings, negative relationships between reflected appraisals and self-esteem were found, although more frequent significant effects were found as an individual moves from home to public places to work.
