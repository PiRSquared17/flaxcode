Sack tapping is a slang term for a form of bullying practiced by some adolescents as a "game" where a male participant attacks, by slapping, tapping, punching, kicking, stomping, elbowing or backhanding, another male victim's testicles. The term derived from 'sack', slang that refers to the scrotum, and the activity is a form of groin attack. This sociological manifestation of bullying can result in severe testicle injury that may require amputation as the only form of treatment. A reported increased popularity of sack tapping, fueled in part by YouTube videos, and the subsequent increase in hospitalization has concerned parents and urologists. It is also called "nut tag", "bag tag", and "roshambo", the last name coming from an episode of "South Park" that featured the practice.

==Sociological impact==

In 2010, a participant lost a testicle caused by physical trauma that resulted from a sack tapping game at school. ABC News' chief medical correspondent Dr. Tim Johnson commented, "the trend isn't restricted to Minnesota", and has "gotten out of control" as per Dr. Scott Wheeler. Dr. Wheeler, a urologist in Minnesota, has seen an increase of hospitalization caused by "sack tapping" incidents, and commented that criminal charges could be filed against the attacker as a result of the one instance. The casualty survived the surgery and can function normally with one testicle. The casualty's mother saw "what he went through every day" and withdrew his enrollment from school. "Sack tapping" has grown into a more dangerous game that can result in greater injuries. Dr. Wheeler recommend that parents warn their children of the dangers of "sack tapping".

Jack Shafer, a journalist for "Slate" online magazine, commented that "sack tapping" is a "bogus trend". He argued that "sack tapping" is not new and has existed for some time. He states that the recent focus is simply "sensationalist journalism". He also claimed to have been "taking shots to my crown jewels when I was a 1960s teenager", that the term has "been listed in the Urban Dictionary since Feb. 27, 2003", and that the Los Angeles Times called it "the latest dangerous craze".
