Pickup artist describes a man who considers himself to be skilled, or who tries to be skilled at meeting, attracting, and seducing women.

The use of "pickup" in this context, slang for making a casual acquaintance with a stranger in anticipation of sexual relations, dates from at least the World War, as attested by antiprostitution posters, and is again attested in the 1970 book "How to Pick Up Girls" by Eric Weber. The phrase was also popularized by "Pick-Up Times", a short-lived 1970s magazine and the 1987 semi-autobiographical film, "The Pick-up Artist", written and directed by James Toback.

The term pickup artist is also associated with the seduction community, a heterosexual male subculture based on the goal of improved sexual and romantic abilities with women. Pickup artists develop pickup lines similar to, yet more complex than the stereotypical pick-up line. Routines and gambits are developed to stimulate "attraction switches" often combined with techniques derived from neuro-linguistic programming. "Spontaneous PUAs" or "Spontaneous Gamers" use both self-help and an understanding of social psychology to achieve this. They aim to improve their seductive capabilities through the development of different lifestyles. The culture surrounding pickup has spawned an entire industry servicing those who want to improve their social and seduction skills with consultations and in-field training. What makes this industry different is that people learn skill sets to meet the women they want, instead of being set up by matchmakers.

There is sufficient interest in pickup that some dating coaches like Nick Savoy, Mystery, JT Tran, Vincent Biagiotti, Adam Lyons, Richard La Ruina, Chris Luna and Owen Cook have become pickup instructors full-time.

New books are being made every year because "game" keeps evolving. Manuals such as "How to be Ridiculously Successful with women for the Rest of Your Life" are new to stores.

The term "pickup artist" entered the popular lexicon in 2005 upon the arrival of Neil Strauss's best selling book, "", also in 2007, from the reality television series, "The Pick-up Artist", shown on VH1, starring Mystery.

Pickup artists and their industry receive mixed to bad responses from the press and general public, with many regarding both the practice and theory immoral, sexist and self-centered. This has led to the creation of companies that disassociate from the industry. Pickup has also been heavily parodied, in March 2011 "The Scott Mills show" on BBC Radio 1 debated Neil Strauss' "" in many shows.
