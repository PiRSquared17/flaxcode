Social cohesion is a broad term used to describe the bonds that bring people together in a given society. The concept is a multi-faceted notion covering many different kinds of social phenomena. It is associated with sociological theories of structural functionalism and in broader fields of political science. 

==Background==
In sociology, the notion of social cohesion is explored in numerous writings such as Durkheim's concept of mechanical and organic solidarity. In "The Division of Labour in Society" Durkheim argued that a society exhibiting mechanical solidarity is characterised by its cohesion and integration comes from relative homogeneity. That is, mechanical solidarity normally operates in "traditional" and small scale societies. In contrast, organic solidarity refers to the interdependence that arises from specialization of work and the complementarities between people, a development which is typically found within "modern" and industrialised societies.

==Policy making==
Social cohesion has become an important theme in British social policy in the period since the disturbances in Britain's Northern mill towns (Oldham, Bradford and Burnley) in the summer of 2001 (see Oldham riots, Bradford riots, Burnley riots). In investigating these, academic Ted Cantle drew heavily on the concept of social cohesion, and the New Labour government (particularly then Home Secretary David Blunkett) in turn widely promoted the notion. As the Runnymede Trust noted in their "The Year of Cohesion" in 2003:

According to the government-commissioned, "State of the English Cities" thematic reports, there are five different dimensions of social cohesion: material conditions, passive relationships, active relationships, inclusion and equality.
*The report shows that material conditions are fundamental to social cohesion, particularly employment, income, health, education and housing. Relations between and within communities suffer when people lack work and endure hardship, debt, anxiety, low self-esteem, ill-health, poor skills and bad living conditions. These basic necessities of life are the foundations of a strong social fabric and important of social progress.
* The second basic tenet of cohesion is social order, safety and freedom from fear, or "passive social relationships". Tolerance and respect for other people, along with peace and security, are hallmarks of a stable and harmonious urban society.
*The third dimension refers to the positive interactions, exchanges and networks between individuals and communities, or "active social relationships". Such contacts and connections are potential resources for places since they offer people and organisations mutual support, information, trust and credit of various kinds.
*The fourth dimension is about the extent of social inclusion or integration of people into the mainstream institutions of civil society. It also includes people's sense of belonging to a city and the strength of shared experiences, identities and values between those from different backgrounds.
*Lastly, social equality refers to the level of fairness or disparity in access to opportunities or material circumstances, such as income, health or quality of life, or in future life chances.

Analysts at the credit rating agency Moody's have also introduced the possibility of adding social cohesion as a formal rating into their sovereign debt indices.

In 2011 a former advisor to Rt Hon John Denham MP launched a new web resource including material focused on the future of the 'cohesion' debate entitled www.theprincipledsociety.com
