=="Perry v. Schwarzenegger" testimony==
During the "Perry v. Schwarzenegger" trial, Dr. Meyer testified for the plaintiffs regarding the mental health impacts on gay couples who are denied the right to marry. He testified on empirical studies showing that gays and lesbians encounter a disproportionate level of stress and mental health difficulties because of discrimination and that these stresses amplify the social stigma that makes homosexuals more susceptible to depression, suicide and substance abuse. When asked if the mental health outcomes for gays and lesbians in California would improve if Proposition 8 were not law, Meyer said, in the affirmative, that "when people are exposed to more stress...they are more likely to get sick, consistent with a law that says to gay people you are not welcome here, your relationships are not valued" and that laws such as Prop. 8 " significant power."
