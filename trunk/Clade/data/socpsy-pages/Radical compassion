Radical compassion is a term coined by the philosopher Khen Lampert, in 2003. His theory of radical compassion appeared in "Traditions of Compassion: from Religious Duty to Social-Activism" (2006). Lampert identifies compassion as a special case of empathy, directed towards the "other's" distress. Radical compassion is a specific type of general compassion, which includes the inner imperative to change reality in order to alleviate the pain of others. This state of mind, according to Lampert's theory, is universal, and stands at the root of the historical cry for social change.
