Robert A. Josephs (born March 29, 1961) is an American Professor of Social and Personality Psychology at The University of Texas at Austin who has conducted research on the behavioral, emotional, and cognitive effects of acute alcohol intoxication. In the late 1980s alongside his mentor Claude M. Steele he helped develop and refine the alcohol myopia model of acute alcohol intoxication.

Currently, his primary area of research is on human behavioral endocrinology with an emphasis on the interaction between the hormones cortisol and testosterone, which are the end products of the stress (cortisol) and reproductive (testosterone) axes of the endocrine system. He and P.H. Mehta have found recently that these two hormones interact to influence dominance, leadership, and language (Josephs & Mehta, 2009).

==Biography==

He graduated from Cornell University in 1983. Before entering graduate school in the Fall of 1984, he spent a year teaching algebra, geometry, and trigonometry to inmates at the Tompkins County Jail in Ithaca, NY. He received his M.S. in Social Psychology from the University of Washington in 1986, and his PhD in Social Psychology from the University of Michigan in 1990. He was hired as an Assistant Professor of Social and Personality psychology at the University of Texas at Austin in 1990 and is now a Full Professor. He is also a Member of the Institute For Neuroscience at UT-Austin.
