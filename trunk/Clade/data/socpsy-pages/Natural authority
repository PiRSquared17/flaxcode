Natural Authority is the authority a person exerts that is innate to them rather than being drawn from some external body. Natural authority relies on factors such as charisma, negotiating skills, assertiveness and self confidence rather than law, political position, wealth or standing in an organization.

Natural authority can also refer to authority that comes about naturally in social situations instead of intentionally, such as wisdom, knowledge or technical ability which one person or a group of people has that another individual or group does not. Natural authority in this sense is seen by anarchists as the only form of legitimate authority in society, because it is seen by anarchists as beneficial and fundamental to human relationships.
