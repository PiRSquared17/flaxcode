1. Social connectedness has multiple aspects. Fundamentally it is about people relating to other people. It is about how people come together, interact and network. It is also one component (of several) of community cohesion. The benefits from social connectedness can accrue to the individual and to society. Social connectedness doesn't just include individual-level concepts (as below in the psychological sense) but also about relationships with and between family, friends, colleagues, neighbours, paid work, sport and other leisure activities, community work and wider communities. Population based surveys sometimes use qualitative questions to help understand the level of social connectedness in communities .

2. Social connectedness is also a psychological term used to describe the quality and number of connections we have with other people in our social circle of family, friends and acquaintances. These connections can be both in real life, as well as online. The more socially connected a person is in his life, generally the greater sense of self-control and self-determination he feels. Zero Acquaintance defines as: “Observation and judgment of someone with whom one has never interacted”.

==Components==
There are six components that have been shown to help a person determine the quality of his interactions and psychological-defined social connectedness with others: 

* Duration of relationship 
* Frequency of interaction with the other person 
* Knowledge of the other person's goals 
* Physical intimacy or closeness with the other person
* Self-disclosure to the other person 
* Social network familiarity—how familiar is the other person with the rest of your social circle

The higher a person scores on these components, the greater the quality of his social connectedness. A scale called the Personal Acquaintance Measure has been developed to help a person measure their connectedness with another individual.
