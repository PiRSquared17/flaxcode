=== Researching Personality judgment===
Professor Funder has worked with Professor Maynard C. Krueger researching over personality judgments. Their work attained to trying to decipher which variables and factors result in either accurate or inaccurate personality judgment’s made from psychologists and "every day people". The experiment of their research consisted of the two Professors retrieving self analyzed information about the patients, judgments created from close acquaintances’ of the patients, and also recordings of the subject's behaviour using taped cameras. This research lead to the understanding that: a "good Judge", a "good Target", a "good trait", and "good information" will lead to a more accurate personal judgement.

=== Researching the "Delay of Gratification"===
Professor David C. Funder has also experimented in the research of an idea known as the "delay of gratification". Funder had performed this experiment with Daryl Bem. To research this idea the two psychologists gathered up a group of children and their parents for a study. The parents were first asked to give personality explanations of their children. Their children were then put into a room sitting in a chair with a bell in front of the child's chair. Next, the children were shown two pieces of candy, one being very appetizing and loved by the child, and the second piece of candy given to the child was less liked and appetizing to his or her sizzling taste buds. The child was then told that if he or she rings the bell an adult will automatically enter the room presenting the candy of less desire, but if he or she waits for someone to come into the room the child will be rewarded with the candy of choice. During this experiment, the personalities of the children willing to wait the longest time for the candy contained a personality of being mostly well mannered, obedient, helpful, but not special and smart. The experiment helped lead Professor David C. Funder to understand that what he actually was testing was the child’s ability to cooperate with adults, not the child's ability to delay gratification.
