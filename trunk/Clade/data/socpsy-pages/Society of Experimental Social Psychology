Nominees are limited to psychologists who are at least five-years post-PhD and have authored at least five papers in top social psychology journals (e.g., the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology). Notable early members included Solomon Asch, Leon Festinger, Harold Kelley, and Stanley Schachter. Its current executive officer is Charles Stangor.
