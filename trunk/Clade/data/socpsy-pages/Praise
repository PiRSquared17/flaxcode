Praise is the act of making positive statements about a person, object or idea, either in public or privately. Praise is typically, but not exclusively, earned relative to achievement and accomplishment. Praise is often contrasted with criticism, where the latter is held to mean exclusively "negative" statements made about something, although this is not technically correct (see also Blame).

==Praise and psychology==

Most people are responsive to praise and will demonstrate an increase in self-esteem or confidence if a suitable amount of praise is received. Some psychological theories hold that a person's life is largely made up of attempts to win praise for their actions. However, some people are less affected by or even averse to praise, for example people with autism or schizoid personality disorder. See motivation

== Praise and religion ==
In modern Christianity, praise is a key part of most services. In the Holy Bible, many of the Psalms are hymns of praise, while Jesus includes praise in the Lord's Prayer that he teaches to his disciples (captured in the phrase "hallowed be thy name").
