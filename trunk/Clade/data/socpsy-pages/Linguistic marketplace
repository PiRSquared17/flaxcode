In sociolinguistics, the linguistic marketplace refers to the theory that the value of a speaker's choice of language depends on his or her role in society. Sociolinguist J.K. Chambers has written that listeners place more value on the language of "professionals of language," such as teachers, authors, and lawyers, than they do on that of chemists or engineers. They similarly place more value on "technicians of language," like actors and secretaries, because these jobs require more interaction with other people and greater proficiency with words.

The need to find employment strongly influences the spoken language, Chambers wrote, usually pushing the speaker towards a standardized tongue or the most prestigious one used in the area. When a lower value is placed on language in occupations requiring little need to talk with others, that push towards standardization does not occur.

The linguistic marketplace also plays a significant role in the ways that the speech of women and men differ, as well as that of various age levels.
