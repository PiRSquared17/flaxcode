Missionary Kids (or MKs) are the children of missionary parents, and thus most were born and/or raised abroad (that is, on the "mission-field"). They can be a subset of Third Culture Kids (TCKs), but not always.

In the past MKs usually were thought of only as American, but there is now a growing number of MKs from other countries, especially Protestant Christian MKs from South Korea and Latin America. Generally, this term applies to Protestant Christians; however, it can be applied to any denomination of a religion.

The term is more specifically applied when these children return to their "home" or passport country (the country of their citizenship) and often experience various difficulties identifying with fellow citizens. The resulting feeling is described as "reverse culture shock." MKs often identify more with where they were raised (and this could be multiple cities, countries, or continents), than where their parents were raised, but are not fully at home in any one culture.

Many colleges, particularly Christian colleges, have chapters of a student organization called "Mu Kappa International," whose aim is to help MKs and other TCKs with the transition to American culture and college life. Mu Kappa was founded in 1985 at Taylor University, and has since spread to more than 40 other colleges and universities.

MKs tend to be open-minded and tolerant of many diverse cultures. They often feel more at home in culturally rich environments and can be "homesick" for their foreign home. Their knowledge of a country and its culture typically exceeds language fluency. Upon returning to their passport country, MKs possess unique skills that can be helpful to academics and governments. Because of their international experience, they often have a much broader worldview than their peers. This broader worldview can also lead to mixed emotions about their passport country and its foreign policies.

Children in the MKs' ancestral home often find it difficult to relate to missionary children, while MKs may find the lives of their peers in their passport countries to be boring, sometimes creating challenging social situations. Interestingly, while MKs often find it difficult to relate to people from their home culture or target culture, they get along with other MKs very well, even those who are missionaries to (or from) a completely different country. MKs may not be aware of many of the pop culture influences within their passport country, yet are able to discuss, in great detail, world politics. They may be able to name the best places to get good food at any of 25 different international airports, and yet not be aware of the most popular television show in their passport country. They are likely to be able to mentally calculate the exchange rate of up to 5 different currencies yet not be able to identify the sport that a given athletic team plays (especially so for American MKs as citizens of a country where the most visible sports leagues often have little or no coverage in the countries where they have lived). These things can cause awkwardness when they return to their passport country.
