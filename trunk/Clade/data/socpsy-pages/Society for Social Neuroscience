The Society for Social Neuroscience (S4SN) is a professional society, headquartered at the University of Chicago for neuroscientists, psychologists, social scientists, and physicians around the world whose research is focused on the study of the biological systems that implement social processes and behavior, or how the brain and nervous system implement social interaction. The mission of the society is to serve as an international, interdisciplinary, distributed gathering place to advance and foster scientific training, research, and applications in the field of social neuroscience.

==History==
The Society for Social Neuroscience was founded on January 10, 2010 in Auckland, New Zealand, after a series of consultations led by John Cacioppo and Jean Decety with social neurobiologists, psychologists, neuroscientists, psychiatrists, and neurologists from all over the world. The result was the establishment of the Society for Social Neuroscience and its inaugural meeting took place on November 12, 2010, the day prior to the 2010 Society for Neuroscience meeting in San Diego, California.
