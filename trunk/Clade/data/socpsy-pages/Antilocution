Antilocution is a term defined by psychologist Gordon Allport in his book "The Nature of Prejudice", 1954. Antilocution is defined as verbal remarks against a person, group or community, which are not addressed directly to the target. Generally referred to as "talking behind someone's back," the impact of this is often overlooked. However because antilocution creates an environment where discrimination is acceptable, it frequently progresses to other more damaging forms of prejudiced behavior. It's use is overshadowed by the more modern term Hate speech which has almost the same meaning.
