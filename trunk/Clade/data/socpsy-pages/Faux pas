A faux pas ( plural: "faux pas" ) is a violation of accepted social norms (for example, standard customs or etiquette rules). Faux pas vary widely from culture to culture, and what is considered good manners in one culture can be considered a faux pas in another. The term comes originally from French, and literally means "misstep" or "false step".

This expression is usually used in social and diplomatic contexts. The term has been in use in English for some time and is no longer italicised when written. In French, it is employed literally to describe a physical loss of balance as well as figuratively, in which case the meaning is roughly the same as in English. Other familiar synonyms include "gaffe" and "bourde" ("bourde", unlike faux pas, can designate any type of mistake). A "fashion faux pas" occurs when the error is directly related to a person's appearance or choice of clothing.

"Faux pas" also sounds similar to "Faut pas", which is French for "Must not", which coincidentally has similar meaning. 

This expression originated during the time of Louis XIV. During his reign, dance was so important in the royal courts that to make a false step in any one of the many dances could get you thrown out.
