Primetime: What Would You Do? is an American television News magazine broadcast on ABC since 2008 as part of the "Primetime" series. Reruns of older episodes began airing on as What Would You Do?: OWN Edition on February 15, 2011 (similar to Dateline on ID and 48 Hours on ID). Currently, What Would You Do? is the only format of Primetime that is aired year-round. Other subjects, such as Family Secrets, are aired in special summer segments.

==Synopsis==
The show is about setting up everyday scenarios that reflect on how people react, why they react, and when they decide to. Scenarios staged are usually injustices or illegal activity; things you do not experience in everyday life. Actors and props are used, as well as hidden cameras to view the action. Whether they're compelled to act or mind their own business, John Quiñones reports on their split-second and often surprising decision-making process. As the interveners finish, Quiñones himself shows up and reveals that they are on TV and the situation is not real. Often people react differently if the actors are switched up in number, race, age or gender. As the experiment goes on, psychology professors, teachers, or club members watch and discuss the video with Quiñones, explaining and making inferences on why the certain reaction is made. This series mainly looks at how they actually do in the face of everyday dilemmas that test their character and values.

==Examples of scenarios==

# A Muslim woman attempts to buy some items from a bakery, though the rude and prejudiced cashier denies any kind of service for her and kicks her out of the store while throwing bigoted comments at her.
# On a sidewalk, three teenagers beat and taunt a homeless man in front of passersby.
# Same-sex parents are at a restaurant with their adopted children, though the waiter attempts to kick the family out of the restaurant, claiming that the parents are "messing up the kids".
# A cafe manager berates, insults, and attempts to kick a breastfeeding mom out of the store. He is disturbed by this and thinks that she is disturbing other customers around her. There were three alternates used in the experiment, replacing the white woman with an African-American woman, a teenager, and a woman consuming alcohol.

# A grocery bagger with noticeable Down syndrome is insulted and raged at by a shopper, who calls him a "retard" because of his condition.

# A young pregnant woman offers her baby to two different couples without their knowledge.
# An Asian American woman berates and insults her young daughter for getting an A- in a test, later the woman is replaced by a Caucasian woman ( this experiment is based on Amy Chua's style of parenting).
