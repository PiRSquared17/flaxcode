In social psychology, the weapons effect states the mere presence, descriptors, or visual representation of a weapon may lead to an increased probability of aggressive behaviors. 

==Support==

===Initial evidence===
Leonard Berkowitz and Anthony LePage proposed the "weapons effect" in their experiment assessing the causal relation between firearms and impulse aggression. In a controlled laboratory setting, experimenters induced anger in half of the participants while the other half of participants did not receive anger induction. The participants were then placed in room containing either firearms or neutral objects, such as badminton rackets, and then given the opportunity to act aggressively by administering electrical shocks to another individual. The results showed angered participants exposed to a rifle or revolver administered significantly more electric shocks than the angered participants exposed to neutral objects.
===Subsequent evidence===
More recent research has shown that weapon-associated words, also known as the "weapons priming effect", increase the likelihood of aggressive responses which may be mediated through weapon-use context and individual familiarity with weapons. Further research suggests that the weapons priming effect's ability to predict aggressive behavior is diminished among frequent weapons users, and a heightened potential for weapon effects exists in societies with lower levels of weapons availability.

==Criticism==

===Internal validity===
The possible confounding variables of weapon familiarity and context pose a threat to the internal validity of Berkowitz and LePage's original formulation of the weapons effect. The original formulation's explanatory power is thereby restricted to specific demographics. 
The reality of weapons serving a defensive function is another possible confound which threatens the internal validity of the weapons effect. Weapons are not exclusively wielded for offensive purposes but can also be used for self-preservation.
===External validity===
The weapons effect succeeds in producing significance in a laboratory setting, but these findings often do not generalize to society. Therefore, many critics dismiss the weapons effect due to its lack of external validity. Archival research suggests that in potentially violent situations, the presence of a weapon may reduce the probability of actual violence since a weapon allows its carrier to exert control over a perceived violent oppressor. Further archival research indicates that individuals who anticipate future victimization are more likely to carry guns for defensive purposes. Thus, the presence of a weapon serves as a buffer against future violence.
