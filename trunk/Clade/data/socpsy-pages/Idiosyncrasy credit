Idiosyncrasy credit is a concept sometimes used in social psychology to refer to hypothetical interpersonal credits that are earned each time an individual makes a contribution to a group, and decreased (spent) each time an individual influences others, makes errors, or deviates from a group's social norms. Idiosyncrasy credits are but one of a number of concepts that attempt to explain how some minority views are influential, while others are not (see Minority influence). Idiosyncrasy credits are also relevant to the study of leadership, as leaders with many credits are often afforded a greater ability to try innovative strategies to meet group goals.

Edwin Hollander (1971) developed the concept of indiosyncrasy credits to explain why some minorities (be they an individual person or a group) experience a positive reaction when expressing their view on an issue, while others experience negative reactions. According to Hollander, idiosyncrasy credits are " the positive impressions of a person held by others, whether defined in the narrower terms of a small face-to-face group or a larger social entity such as an organization or even a total society" (1971, p. 573).

== How "credits" work ==

Idiosyncrasy credits accumulate when members of a group interact. Typically, credits are gained by a member when he or she contributes to the progress of the group. Contributions can include specific tasks carried out by a person (e.g., when an individual completes a high-quality report at work), or simply agreeing with the majority vote on a certain topic (e.g., "Yeah! I like rock music too!").

Minorities who build up idiosyncrasy credit are more influential in all-male groups.

==Leadership==

Idiosyncrasy credits also play a role in group situations that require leadership. Hollander (1958) argued that leaders who acted in a highly conformist manner also accumulate idiosyncrasy credits over time (and thus, as they climbed the organizational ladder). Thus, when a highly conformist leader arrives at the top of the organizational ladder, he or she is free to 'spend' their accumulated idiosyncrasy credits by behaving in an innovative and creative manner.

Numerous research studies support Hollander's initial claims. For example, a study by Hollander and Julian (1970) found that leaders of groups involved in decision-making tasks who were democratically elected (presumbably because they had acted in the most conformist way to the group, and thus had many idiosyncrasy credits) garnered more support from the group, felt more competent , and were more likely to suggest unique and divergent from the other members of the group than those who were not democratically elected. Similar results were obtained in a study by Merei (1949) that examined children's leadership potential. In this study, older children were placed into small groups of younger children in a Hungarian nursery. The children who exhibited the most success were those who initially acted in a conformist manner, and only later introduced minor variations in group practice.

More recent research (e.g., Hogg, 2001; Knippenberg & Hogg, 2003) has explained this phenomenon by stating that group normative behaviour on the part of the leader effectively communicates to the group that the leader is "one of their own" – a central, contributing member who identifies with the group, and acts in the best interest of the group. Thus, leaders with many idiosyncrasy credits are afforded more trust and leeway when suggesting unique or innovative ways of conducting the group's activities, as the group believes that whatever is suggested by the leader is in the best interest of the group.

== Low- versus high-status members ==

As high-status members of a group have typically contributed sizeably to the group of which they are a part, and often possess valued personal characteristics, they are likely to have more idiosyncrasy credits.

Meanwhile, low-status members have typically contributed less to the group, and thus, have fewer idiosyncrasy credits. Thus, they are allowed less room for nonconformity.
