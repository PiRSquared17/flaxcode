Industrial & Organizational Assessment 

Going back to its roots, Industrial & Organizational Assessment derives from social psychology. For the most part, Industrial & Organizational Assessment “examines the role of the work environment in performance and other outcomes including job satisfaction and health” (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_and_organizational_psychology).

There are multiple ways that Industrial & Organizational Assessment has been defined. 

Guion (1965) defines I–O psychology as "the scientific study of the relationship between man and the world of work: ... in the process of making a living" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_and_organizational_psychology). 

While a more detailed definition is given by Blum & Naylor (1968) – it is "simply the application or extension of psychological facts and principles to the problems concerning human beings operating within the context of business and industry" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_and_organizational_psychology). 

In short, Industrial and Organizational Assessment helps businesses and individuals figure out equilibrium between what is healthy and what is expected in the workplace. Balancing this equilibrium is a daunting and continuous task, but with the aid of Industrial & Organizational Assessment, this task can be successfully completed.

Areas of Assessment

When looking deeper into Industrial & Organizational Assessment, the topic looks at four different areas—Jobs, Work, Performance, and People. Looking at each category gives great insight into how Industrial & Organizational Assessment truly works, and what is necessary to complete each step of the process. These four categories can be further broken down into three sections and looked at in greater detail.
First Section - Assessing Jobs & Work

The knowledge needed to assess jobs and work consists of three parts—

1) Alternative methods for describing work 

2) Alternative methods for describing the human attributes necessary to perform the work

3) Use of the numerous inventories used to describe work and worker characteristics

Each part is detrimental to completing assessment in this area, and requires a multitude of tools to ensure successful completion. These tools are vast; however, below there are a few of the most popular types listed:
Position Analysis Questionnaire 

According to Job-Analysis.Net, “The Position Analysis Questionnaire (PAQ) developed by McCormick, Jeanneret, and Mecham (1972) is a structured job analysis instrument to measure job characteristics and relate them to human characteristics. It consists of 195 job elements that represent in a comprehensive manner the domain of human behavior involved in work activities”. 

The items that fall into the following five categories: 

1. Information input (where and how the worker gets information), 

2. Mental processes (reasoning and other processes that workers use), 

3. Work output (physical activities and tools used on the job), 

4. Relationships with other persons, and 

5. Job context (the physical and social contexts of work). 

Going further, Job-Analysis.Net states that “over the course of many studies, PAQ researchers have aggregated PAQ data for hundreds of jobs; that database are maintained by Purdue University. A wealth of research exists on the PAQ; it has yielded reasonably good reliability estimates and has been linked to several assessment tools” (http://www.job-analysis.net/G012.htm).

Occupational Analysis Inventory 

This second tool has also been critiqued by Job-Analysis.Net. The website states, “The Occupational Analysis Inventory (OAI) contains 617 "work elements." It was designed to yield more specific job information than other multi-job questionnaires such as the PAQ while still capturing work requirements for virtually all occupations. The major categories of items are five-fold: (1) Information Received, (2) Mental Activities, (3) Work Behavior, (4) Work Goals, and (5) Work Context. OAI respondents rate each job element on one of four rating scales: part-of-job, extent, applicability, or a special scale designed for the element. The OAI has been used to gather information on 1,400 jobs selected to represent five major occupational categories. Reliabilities obtained with the OAI have been moderate, somewhat lower than those achieved with the PAQ” (http://www.job-analysis.net/G012.htm).

Functional Job Analysis

This last tool is the final tool examined by Job-Analysis.Net, the website’s findings state, “Beginning in the 1940s, Functional Job Analysis (FJA) was used by U.S. Employment Service job analysts to classify jobs for the DOT (Fine & Wiley, 1971). The most recent version of FJA uses seven scales to describe what workers do in jobs: (1) Things, (2) Data, (3) People, (4) Worker Instructions, (5) Reasoning, (6) Math, and (7) Language. Each scale has several levels that are anchored with specific behavioral statements and illustrative tasks. Like other job analysis instruments, FJA is a methodology for collecting job information. While it was used for many years as a part of the DOT, the Department of Labor is replacing the DOT with O*NET and will not be using FJA in O*NET. There is no current database of jobs (other than the DOT) containing FJA data for jobs in the national economy” (http://www.job-analysis.net/G012.htm).

Assessing Performance

This second aspect of Industrial & Organizational Assessment looks at the actual performance given by individuals. The knowledge needed to perform this aspect of assessment can be summed up in two parts—subjective and objective measures of job performance AND Behavior-focused rating forms. These two aspects of assessing performance are key. A few examples of these key aspects are Behaviorally Anchored Ratings Scales (BARS) and Behavior Observation Scales (BOS). 

Assessing Individuals

The final aspect of Industrial & Organizational Assessment is assessing individuals. This is quite possibly the most complex step of assessment. It goes without question that a background in psychology would help any assessor perform their duty more effectively, and perhaps with more ease.

The knowledge and skills necessary to perform this last leg of assessment boils down to one aspect—knowing a variety of procedures for assessing individuals. While this aspect seems broad, there are many detailed tools to help narrow down the ways in which this branch of assessment can be carried out. 

These tools include:

Psychological tests

Biographical information

Interviews

Work samples

Assessment centers

Surveys

Use of computers in assessment

In order to gain a better idea of how all the knowledge and tools come together within the four categories of Industrial & Organizational Assessment to accomplish a task in the work place, below are five examples, provides by the Society for Industrial & Organizational Psychology, Inc.

Examples of Industrial and Organizational Assessment

1. Assessing the content of work via job analysis procedures for the purpose of developing performance appraisal procedures.

2. Assessing the human requirements of work via job analysis procedures for the purpose of developing or identifying personnel selection procedures.

3. Assessing individual characteristics via psychological tests, interviews, work samples, and other means for selecting individuals into jobs and career development.

4. Assessing employee knowledge, skill or work performance via a host of evaluation procedures for the purpose of identifying training needs. 

5. Assessing employee perceptions of work environment characteristics via survey procedures for the purpose of managing an organizations climate.
