1. Make a folder for Flax, say c:\work\Flax
2. Check out the Flax sources to this folder
3. Install Python 2.5 (to the default folder, C:\Python25)
4. Add this folder to your Path (Control Panel, System, Advanced, Environment Variables)
5. Install pywin32 for Python 2.5
6. Install py2exe for Python 2.5
        HACK: py2exe currently needs patching:
        http://www.selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial-devel/2006-November/000353.html
7. Install InnoSetup and add its folder to your path
8. Install Zlib from http://www.zlib.net/ - extract zlib1.dll from the ZIP file and put it in the same folder as this text file
9. Compile Xapian and the Python bindings (currently we need the version held
in the tarballs in the xappy\libs directory). Copy xapian.py to C:\Python25\lib\site-packages and _xapian.pyd to the same folder as this text file.
10. Start a command line window (Start|Run|cmd.exe), and run
    cd \work\Flax
    python utils/install_dependencies.py
    cd win32setup
    python setup_svc.py install
11. The packaged, standalone Flax should be in the packages/ subfolder
