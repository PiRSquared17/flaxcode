Flax Search Service Tutorial
============================

Overview
========

This document, and associated files, covers the basics of running the Flax Search Service
and using it to index, retrieve, and search for documents using a simple schema. It is 
applicable to all the existing client libraries (Python, PHP and Perl).


Requirements
============

To follow this tutorial, you will need:  
FIXME: links

    1. Xapian 1.0.6 or later installed on your computer.
    2. Python 2.5 or 2.6 (required for the search service).
    3. Xapian Python bindings.
    4. Flax Search Service and Search Clients.

To follow the tutorial with the PHP client library, you will need the PHP 5 command-line 
interpreter. Perl 5 is required for the Perl client.

The ``curl`` command may be useful for talking directly to the Search Service from the 
command line.


Getting Started
===============

If necessary, install the required software. Then start the Search Service by cd'ing 
to the ``flax_search_service`` directory and running:

    ``python runserver.py``
    
This will start the server listening on port 8080. To use a different port (if for example
you have an existing service on 8080), edit the ``settings.py`` file and replace "8080"
in the ``server_bind_address`` parameter with a suitable value.

By default, the search service stores data in ``/tmp``. To specify a different location,
supply it as a parameter when starting the service, e.g.:

    ``python runserver.py /usr/lib/flaxdata``

If you have the ``curl`` command available, you can test Flax by opening another terminal
window and running:

    ``curl http://localhost:8080/'

This will return information about the search service, formatted as JSON, e.g.:

    ``{"backends": {}, "versions": {"PROTOCOL": "dev20090312", "SERVER": "0.1"}}``

Don't worry about the exact meaning of these values for now!
