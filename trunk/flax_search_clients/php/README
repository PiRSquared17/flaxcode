Flax Search Service Client for PHP
==================================

The Flax Search Service Client (FSSC) for PHP is a simple library to simplify 
working with the Flax Search Service (FSS) in PHP.


Prerequisites
-------------
FSSC requires PHP 5 with the libcurl extension. In order to run the unit tests,
you will need the simpletest framework.

Note - the debian/ubuntu package of php-simpletest doesn't seem to work, so
instead just download the tarball from http://simpletest.org/en/download.html
and unpack it in the unittest directory (producing a subdirectory of unittests
called "simpletest").


Unit tests
----------
To run the unit tests, cd into the the "unittests" directory, then run:

    php runtests.php <FSS base URL>

e.g.:

    php runtests.php http://localhost:8080/

This should produce output reporting that all the tests have passed, e.g.:

    All tests
    OK
    Test cases run: 4/4, Passes: 38, Failures: 0, Exceptions: 0


Documentation
-------------
API documentation is provided in the file docs/API.rst


Examples
--------
An example application consisting of a very simple NewsML indexer and a search
GUI are provided in the "examples" directory. To run this, you will need a source
of NewsML data (such as the Reuters Corpus). Then to create a searchable database,
first make sure that FSS is running, then cd into the "examples" directory and run:

    php <FSS base URL> <data directory>

where <data directory> contains NewsML files with the .xml extension. e.g.:

    php http://localhost:8080/ /var/newsml-data

To run the GUI search, make sure that the flax_search_client/php directory is 
accessible to your web server and the PHP is enabled. Then point your browser
at the "newsml_search.php" file. This should display a simple forms interface
and allow you to search for text in the source data.
