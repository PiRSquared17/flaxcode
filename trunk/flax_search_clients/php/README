FIXME - write a proper README.

To run the unit tests, ensure that PHP is installed, and the php-simpletest
package is installed, then run (from inside the unittests directory)::

  php runtests.php

Note - the debian/ubuntu package of php-simpletest doesn't seem to work, so
instead just download the tarball from http://simpletest.org/en/download.html
and unpack it in the unittest directory (producing a subdirectory of unittests
called "simpletest").
