  <p><b><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Clifford Geertz interviewed 
    by Alan Macfarlane in Cambridge, 6<sup>th</sup> May 2004</font></b></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PART ONE</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">0:00:36 Biographical details 
    – early life and education – influential teachers – family</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">0:09:04 War service in 
    the Navy</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">0:11:48 End of war  writing 
    short stories in San Francisco – Antioch University, Ohio – influential teachers 
    – encouraged to become an anthropologist after reading English and Philosophy 
    but seeing no future in that direction – marriage to Hildred who also majored 
    in English and similarly at a loss – grant to do anthropology at Harvard under 
    Kluckhohn </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">0:15:50 Margaret Mead 
    – both Hildred and self introduced to her fieldwork methods and encouraged 
    to become anthropologists – both accepted to do anthropology at Harvard</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">0:17:30 Impressions of 
    Margaret Mead – kindness – made effort to see them  in Bali  and to introduce 
    them to influential person – Freeman controversy – meeting with Derek Freeman 
    – feels he should have made criticism when Mead was still alive and could 
    defend herself – ‘Coming of Age in Samoa’ written when she was 26 – what he 
    knows of Samoa suggests not all right or all wrong</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">0:25:08 Harvard – memories 
    of Clyde Kluckhohn – tortured man – grew up in Iowa, adopted by the Kluckhohns 
    – sick all his life – sent to the South when young and became a Navaho specialist 
    – dysfunctional family - hard to deal with but was supportive</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">0:28:40 Talcott Parsons 
    – benevolent and kind though not a great influence – produced some very good 
    students – very intelligent – caught up in the tension between Kluckhohn and 
    Parsons – interpreter of Max Weber</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">0:32:44 Influence of Max 
    Weber on self – other influential thinkers including Marx and Durkheim – thinks 
    of himself as a ‘fox’ not a ‘hedgehog’ unlike Parsons</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">0:34:41 Earlier tradition 
    of American anthropology – Ruth Benedict – Robert Lowie – Alfred Kroeber – 
    Ralph Linton – Edward Sapir – Franz Boas </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">0:37:51 Harvard PhD – 
    fieldwork ‘rite de passage’ - at that time had to be outside US in another 
    language – Douglas Oliver, teaching at Peabody, invited him and wife to be 
    part of a project to study Javanese kinship and religion for two years – no 
    knowledge of Indonesia beforehand – well financed by Ford Foundation – both 
    joined the group – language training for a year then went to Java – Kluckhohn 
    had suggested them to Oliver</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">0:40:18 First impressions 
    – first to Leiden to improve Dutch and to meet scholars – ship to Indonesia 
    – day before arrival rebellion against Sukarno government started – tanks 
    on streets – taken to safe house by Indonesian friends – very tense for first 
    few days until Sukarno prevailed </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">0:42:51 Sent to Jojakarta, 
    Central Java where National University (Gadjah Mada) was founded in Sultan’s 
    palace – beautiful town at that time – idea that they with three professors 
    and thirty students would sit in hotel and interview people who’d be called 
    in – refused to work in this way and found a suitable fieldwork site in Pare 
    where the team stayed for two years – detached themselves from students although 
    some bitterness for a time </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">0:49:50 Nature of fieldwork 
    – pleasure – war and illness – went off to Bali – later Morocco – challenge 
    is to understand people who are quite different from self –Javanese, Balinese 
    and Moroccans endlessly intriguing – freedom to do it in one’s own way</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">0:55:11 Never had one 
    single question – a ‘fox’, a pluralist – I think people really are different 
    so not looking for common thread but particular expressions – coming from 
    Literature look at what is extraordinary and different about famous writers 
    – looking for the Javaneseness of the Javanese etc. – interested in peoples’ 
    ways of being in the world – don’t agree with idea that we should study other 
    peoples to better understand ourselves </font></p>
