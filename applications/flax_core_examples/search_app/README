This is a minimal example web app for searching flax.core databases, 
demonstrating searching, filters, facets and ranges, and written in Python.

To run this app, you will need Python 2.5 or higher plus:

    - xapian, with Python bindings ( http://xapian.org/ )
    - flax.core ( http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/source/checkout )
    - web.py framework ( http://webpy.org/ )
    - mako templates ( http://www.makotemplates.org/ )

You will also need one or more xapian databases created with a flax.core
indexer (such as applications/flax_core_examples/xml_indexer in the flaxcode
repository). The directory is specified by DBDIR in the app code.

Run the search app from the command line:

    $ python search_app.py

And point a browser at http://localhost:8080/ to choose and search a database.
