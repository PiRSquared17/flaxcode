            The aim of philosophy is to seek the explanation of all
            things: the quest is for the first causes of everything, and also
            how all things are, and finally why, with what design, with a view
            to what, things are. That is why, taking "principle" in all the senses
            of the word, it has been called the science of first principles.

        In Locke the central presuppositions, which he embraced heartily and
        without question, were those of common sense. He adopted what he calls a
        "plain, historical method", fit, in his own words, "to be brought into
        well-bred company and polite conversation".

            When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake of
            his home, and went into the mountains. There he enjoyed his spirit and
            solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it. But at last his heart
            changed, and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the
            sun, and spake thus unto it:
            Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those 
            for whom thou shinest!
