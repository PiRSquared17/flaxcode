Wed Oct 10 23:04:12 BST 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/templates/flax.html: Change character encoding to utf-8: this
	  is the character set that output from xappy will be in, so we
	  might as well use it for display.

Wed Oct 10 16:28:11 BST 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* src/doc_collection.py: Move future import before __docformat__.

	* src/cpserver.py,src/filespec.py,src/dbspec.py,src/doc_collection.py:
	  Add standard license and copyright header, and tidy up some code
	  comments and whitespace.  Remove "$ID:" markers.  Tidy up code to
	  follow PEP8 better (remove whitespace around = when specifying
	  default arguments to functions, and change multiline
	  documentation comments to start with """Single line of text...
	  and to end with a blank line before the closing """).
	  Change DBSpec.update() to accept any sequence or iterator for its
	  stopwords argument.

Wed Oct 10 16:07:42 BST 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=18 Added a
	  "basename" field to hold the base filename, and arranged for the
	  indexer to add content to this. Also added a managed dictionary
	  to communicate the state of indexing between the indexer and web
	  server as per
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=7 ( not yet

	* src/cpserver.py: whitespace tidying.

Tue Oct 09 09:23:41 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/cpserver.py: removed the code to process filter settings
	  since the form no longer contains such elements.

Tue Oct 09 04:54:06 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/indexserver/indexer.py: FIXES:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=1 Checked for
	  existence of collection database. If it's not there log an error

	* src/templates/options.html,src/templates.py: FIXES:
	  http://code.google.com/p/flaxcode/issues/detail?id=3 Removed the
	  UI options to modify filter settings. Note that persistent data
	  with other filters set now have no user accessible way of
	  changing the filters, so flax.flx probably needs to be deleted.

	  the indexserver at the moment). Arranged for the web server to
	  start the indexserver process.

Sun Oct 07 11:16:49 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/logconfserver/filewatch.py,src/util.py: moved implementation

	* src/dbspec.py,src/doc_collection.py,src/flax_collections.py: Use

	  party modules if they're only locally installed.
	* src/setuppaths.py: New module which simply calls
	  util.setup_sys_path() when it's imported.  This is convenient
	  because it will only call it the first time it's imported, so we
	  don't end up repeatedly modifying sys.path.
	* src/util.py: Add "lib" to sys.path as well as "libs/xappy", since
	  this is where the new utils/install_dependencies.py script puts
	  them.
	* ChangeLog: Update.

Wed Oct 03 16:00:42 UTC 2007  Richard Boulton <richard@lemurconsulting.com>

	* utils/install_dependencies.py: Add script which downloads the

Tue Oct 02 12:17:54 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	* src/schedulespec.py: (This file inadvertently ommited form last

Wed Sep 26 12:06:28 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	  documents. Documents include a "collection" field, and this
	  togther with the document id is used to verify that the file is
	  one that was actually indexed at some point. This provides a form
	  of security (so that we're not serving arbitrary files, but we
	  need to think harder about whether this provides a loophole
	  allowing any files from the server to be downloaded). (this file
	  inadvertently ommitted from last checkin.)

Wed Sep 26 12:05:13 UTC 2007  Paul Rudin <paul@rudin.co.uk>

	  actually indexed at some point. This provides a form of security
	  (so that we're not serving arbitrary files, but we need to think
	  harder about whether this provides a loophole allowing any files
	  from the server to be downloaded).
