Objectification is the process by which an abstract concept is made as objective as possible in the purest sense of the term. It is also treated as if it is a concrete thing or physical object. In this sense the term is a synonym to . 

This term is also used to describe the treatment of a human being as a thing, disregarding his/her personality or sentience.
Philosopher Martha Nussbaum has argued that something is objectified if any of the following factors is present: 
*Instrumentality – if the thing is treated as a tool for one's own purposes; 
*Denial of autonomy – if the thing is treated as if lacking in agency or self-determination; 
*Inertness – if the thing is treated as if lacking in agency; 
*Ownership – if the thing is treated as if owned by another; 
*Fungibility – if the thing is treated as if interchangeable; 
*Violability – if the thing is treated as if permissible to damage or destroy; 
*denial of subjectivity – if the thing is treated as if there is no need to show concern for the 'object's' feelings and experiences.
