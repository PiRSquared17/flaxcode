Prosperity consciousness is a term and teaching often referred to in New Age and New Thought communities, and it is a term sometimes used by financial professionals. It describes the belief that by opening one's mind to the financial opportunities in the world, and by living a life and having a perspective that welcomes financial resources, one will bring financial wealth into one's life. Prosperity consciousness is based primarily on a belief in the Law of Attraction and its use for attracting more wealth.
