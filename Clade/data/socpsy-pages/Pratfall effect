The pratfall effect is a psychological phenomenon whereby the attractiveness of a person perceived as competent increases if the person commits a blunder. Conversely, the attractiveness of a person perceived as incompetent decreases if the person commits a blunder.

==Psychological effect==

Originally described in 1966 in a research paper by Aronson, the "pratfall effect" has become established in popular culture, popular sport psychology, and management jargon. The effect implies that always being perfect - like always being incompetent - is less likeable than being competent but fallible, and able to admit mistakes. For example, it may be helpful to politicians to accept responsibility for errors, as voters then perceive them as human and honest. Later research has refined the popular picture but without refuting it.
