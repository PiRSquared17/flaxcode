The Social Psychology Network (SPN) is an educational organization with more than 1,500 members worldwide. Founded by Scott Plous in 1996, the Network grew in its first three years to include more than 3,500 searchable links and three affiliated partner sites: the Society of Experimental Social Psychology (SESP.org); the Society for Personality and Social Psychology; and Research Randomizer (Randomizer.org, a web-based tool for random sampling and random assignment). By late 1998, the pages of SPN had been visited more than 750,000 times, and the National Science Foundation invited Dr. Plous to apply for a grant to further develop the Network.
