In physics, physiology and sociology, social behavior is behavior directed towards society, or taking place between, members of the same species. Behavior such as predation which involves members of different species is not social. While many social behaviors are communication (provoke a response, or change in behavior, without acting directly on the receiver) communication between members of different species is not social behavior. The umbrella term behavioral sciences is used to refer to sciences that study behaviorality disturbance in general.

In sociology, "behavior" itself means an animal-like activity devoid of social meaning or social context, in contrast to "social behavior" which has both. In a sociological hierarchy, social behavior is followed by social actions, which is directed at other people and is designed to induce a response. Further along this ascending scale are social interaction and social relation. In conclusion, social behavior is a process of communicating.

Among specific social behaviors are regarded, e.g., aggression, altruism, scapegoating and shyness.

'Monosociality' describes social relations (or preference for such relations) with the same sex of a (putatively) nonsexual nature. 'Bisociality' describes social relations (or preference for such relations) with both the same and opposite sexes, also of a (putatively) nonsexual nature.
