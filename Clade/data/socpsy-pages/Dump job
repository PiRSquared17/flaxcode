A dump job is a type of homicide in which the body of the victim is transported to another location and abandoned. This slang term originated with the American police, but has come to be used in a wider context to signify an act of avoiding unwanted responsibility.

==Police usage==
In police work (and presumably serving as the source of its wider use) a "dump job" is the abandonment of a dead human body, especially without significant concealment after its removal from the place of death. The specific intent of a dump job is to obscure someone's association with the death, which can include direct responsibility for the death or involvement in circumstances surrounding the death.

Such cases often entail extra forensics difficulties. Dump jobs also suggest to investigators that the death may have occurred in the context of otherwise illegal or scandalous circumstances, panic, and/or awareness of the criminal nature of death.

== Wider usage ==

The term may also be applied (to some degree as a metaphor based on the police term) in any collaborative work situation, where a person or group declines to take on an unwelcome task even though they might be best suited for the job. The term is especially applied when the failure to act is accompanied by specific steps that increase the likelihood of the task's allocation to others.
