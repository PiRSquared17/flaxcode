In Social Psychology theory, choice overload is implicated in research into situations where people are confronted with many choices versus just a few choices. These findings have results that run counter to the popular notion that more choice is better. When confronted with a plethora of choices without perfect information, many people prefer to make no choice at all, even if making a choice would lead to a better outcome.
