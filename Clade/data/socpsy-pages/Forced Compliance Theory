Forced Compliance Theory is a paradigm that is closely related to Cognitive Dissonance Theory. It has been briefly studied in the field of Social Psychology but is becoming more prevalent.

Forced Compliance Theory is the idea that authority or some other perceived higher ranking person can force an individual to say or perform acts that are against their better judgment. It focuses on the goal of altering an individual's attitude through persuasion and authority.

Forced Compliance Theory can be carried out with two different outcomes in mind:
1) Counter-motivational-which is conducting actions that the individual does not want to do.
2) Counter-attitudinal-which is getting the individual to make statements that they agree or like something that they actually don't

== Original research ==
Leon Festinger and James M. Carlsmith (1959) conducted an experiment entitled "Cognitive Consequences of Forced Compliance." This study involved 71 male students from Stanford University. The students were asked to perform a tedious task involving using one hand to turn small spools a quarter clockwise turn. The purpose was to make the task uninteresting and unexciting enough that none of the participants could possibly find it enjoyable. "psychclassics">[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Festinger/].</ref>

There was a control condition and an experimental condition. The experimental condition was told before the experiment started that it would be fun, while the control condition was not told anything before. The control condition were asked to go to a room to be interviewed. The experimental condition involved giving either $1 or $20 to try and convince the next participant that the experiment was fun and exciting.<"Original Research">[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Festinger/].</ref>

The results showed that there was a significant difference between the $1 group and control group. Also there was a large difference between the $1 and $20 groups. However, there was not a significant difference between the $20 group and control group. The results indicate that the smaller reward group ($1) had convinced themselves that the experiment was fun. <"Original Research">[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Festinger/].</ref>

In summary, this study resulted in the conclusion that if an individual performs an action that goes against what they personally believe, they will typically change what they believe.

=== Cognitive Dissonance Theory ===
Forced Compliance Theory is essentially a subset of Cognitive Dissonance Theory. Cognitive Dissonance Theory is associated with the unpleasant feeling that come along with having two opposing ideas at the same time. It is most persuasive when it comes to feelings and thoughts about oneself. It is also a strong motivational tool in influencing us to choose one action or thought over another.

Forced Compliance Theory is being used as a mechanism to possibly help aid in projections of Cognitive Dissonance Theory.

=== Study 1 ===
Robert Helmreich and Barry E. Collins conducted an experiment, Studies in Forced Compliance: Commitment and Magnitude of Inducement to Comply as Determinants of Opinion Change.

This study consisted of sixty-sixty male college students who were asked to record a counter-attitudinal statement concerning a serious issue. There were three different variables which included multiple levels of commitment. These levels included commitment anonymous audio recording, identified video recording, and identified video recording without a chance to withdraw their statement. Half of the participants were asked to make the recording, while the other half was asked to make the counter statement.<"Study 1">[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022351407622146].</ref>

The participants were paid a certain amount of money for their tasks and results found that in the two highest levels of commitment (identified video recordings) participants who received low pay exhibited more attitude change. However, within the lower commitment level (anonymous audio recording) participants, the higher pay yielded more attitude change.

=== Study 2 ===
Richard D. Ashmore and Barry E. Collins conducted an experiment, Studies in Forced Compliance: X. Attitude Change and Commitment to Maintain Publicly a Counter-attitudinal Position.

In this study, researchers manipulated three variables that were expected to alter attitude change yielded by forced compliance. These three variables included public-private, true-persuasive, and high-low financial motivation. <"Study 2">[http://www.amsciepub.com/doi/abs/10.2466/pr0.1968.22.3c.1229].</ref>

At the beginning of the study, public subjects, as opposed to private subjects, signed a document in which they vowed to preserve their counter-attitudinal position outside of the study. Results showed that the public subjects were more likely to exhibit more of an attitude change compared to the private subjects.<"Study 2">[http://www.amsciepub.com/doi/abs/10.2466/pr0.1968.22.3c.1229].</ref>

=== Study 3 ===
French researchers Jean-Leon, Marc Bungert, and Pascale Mariette conducted an experiment, Forced Compliance: Commitment to Compliance and Commitment to Activity.

This study consisted of two experiments with one experiment involving 200 adolescent and adults and another involving 176 high school-aged participants.

The study based itself off of previous research that states when individuals are not granted the freedom to agree or disagree with the task that is asked of them in forced compliance situations, signs of dissonance are not detected.
