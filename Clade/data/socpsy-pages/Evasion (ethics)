Evasion is, in ethics, an act that deceives by stating a true statement that is irrelevant or leads to a false conclusion. 

For instance, a man knows that another man is in a room in the building because he heard him, but in answer to a question, says, "I have not seen him," thereby falsely implying that he does not know.

It is argued for as a way to fulfill both the obligations of telling the truth and of, in justice, keeping secrets from those not entitled to know the truth, but is regarded as unjustifiable without grave reason for withholding the truth.

Evasions are closely related to equivocations and mental reservations; indeed, some statements fall under both descriptions.
