Mistrust means "to doubt, to lack confidence in". It does not necessarily imply any serious suspicion of malice or bad faith.

This can happen in everyday life in situations where the parties otherwise trust each other, but find themselves questioning that trust. Mistrust is different from distrust, which means much the same but adds suspicion to the mix: it is reserved more for a situation where bad faith is suspected.
