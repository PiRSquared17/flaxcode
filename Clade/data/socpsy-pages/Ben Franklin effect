The Ben Franklin effect is a psychological finding: A person who has "done" someone a favor is more likely to do that person another favor than they would be if they had "received" a favor from that person. Similarly, one who harms another is more willing to harm them again than the victim is to retaliate.

==Recognition of effect by Franklin==
In the words of Benjamin Franklin, who famously observed the effect and for whom it is named, "He that has once done you a Kindness will be more ready to do you another, than he whom you yourself have obliged."

In his autobiography, Franklin explains how he dealt with the animosity of a rival legislator when he served in the Pennsylvania legislature in the 18th Century

==Effect as an example of cognitive dissonance==

This perception of Franklin has been cited as an example within cognitive dissonance theory, which says that people change their attitudes or behavior to resolve tensions, or "dissonance", between their thoughts, attitudes, and actions. In the case of the Ben Franklin effect, the dissonance is between the subject's negative attitudes to the other person and the knowledge that they did that person a favor.
