Body-to-body communication is related to the term "face-to-face communication", but it describes the complexity of human communication in more depth. The term reflects the idea that communication among humans requires not only verbal communication accompanied by facial expressions. Body-to-body communication involves postures, body language, positioning in the environment, nonverbal language, gestures, movements and in general the people as a whole.
