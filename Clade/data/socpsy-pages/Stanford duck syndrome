The Stanford duck syndrome is a Stanford student sociological and study skills condition characterized by appearing calm and composed on surface but in truth working extremely hard to stay afloat. The metaphor is an oft-heard characterization of Stanford students who tend to be overachievers but who are reticent about sharing their problems.

According to "2003 Fiske Guide to Colleges," this syndrome describes students who ""look peaceful on the surface but are paddling like mad underneath".

In January 2005, the Stanford Frosh Council organized a meeting "Addressing the Stanford Duck Syndrome: Calm on the Surface But Paddling Like Mad To Stay Afloat" to formally address the issue in front of a group of seventy five (75) administrators. The administrators subsequently took action to combat the syndrome by creating an online platform to help students - especially freshmen - cope with school life. The Mid-Year Convocation for freshmen was also part of the effort to "make students feel more comfortable with expressing their frustrations."
