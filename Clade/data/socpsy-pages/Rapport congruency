Rapport congruency is the human tendency to form a rapport with someone who seems to be portraying a common role, such as a friend. When someone acts like a friend or an enemy, the human mind is more likely to associate them with filling that role, even on meeting the person for the first time.

Déjà vu is often associated as one of the major factors in rapport congruency.
