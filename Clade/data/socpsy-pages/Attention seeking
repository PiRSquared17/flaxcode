Enjoying the attention of others is in socially acceptable. In some instances, however, the need for attention can lead to difficulties. The term attention seeking (or attention-seeking) is generally reserved for such situations where excessive and "inappropriate attention seeking" is seen.

==Styles==
The following styles of attention seeking have been identified:
* Extroverted positive overt style – associated with narcissism, bragging and boasting. May also include shocking exhibitionist behavior such as streaking.
* Extroverted positive subdued style – similar but more subtle such as wearing designer clothes, wearing sexy clothes or dominating the conversation.
* Extroverted negative overt style – to gain pity and reassurance.
* Extroverted negative subdued style – making a negative statement to the world by, for example, dressing in an unusual style.

==In different pathologies or contexts==
* Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
* Münchausen by Internet
* Münchausen syndrome
* Münchausen syndrome by proxy
* Personality disorders – A sustained pattern of attention seeking in adults is often associated with, in particular, histrionic personality disorder – but it may instead be associated with narcissistic personality disorder or borderline personality disorder. The expression drama queen is associated with histrionic behavior.
* Self-destructive behavior – It is a common misconception that self-destructive behavior is inherently attention seeking, or at least that attention is a primary motive. While this is undoubtedly true in some cases, normally the motivation runs much deeper than that. Many self-injurers are very self-conscious of their wounds and scars and feel guilty about their behavior leading them to go to great lengths to conceal their behavior from others.
* Voluntary false confession

==Tactical ignoring==

Tactical ignoring, also known as planned ignoring, is a behavioral management strategy used in response to challenging behavior that seeks to receive attention or to gain a reaction from others. It is a commonly used strategy when the person displaying the attention seeking behavior still feels rewarded by a negative response.
