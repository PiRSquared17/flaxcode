Construal level theory (CLT) is a theory in social psychology that describes the relation between psychological distance and the extent to which people's thinking (e.g., about objects and events) is abstract or concrete. . The general idea is that the more distant an object is from the individual the more abstract it will be thought of, while the opposite relation between closeness and concreteness is true as well. In CLT, psychological distance is defined on several dimensions - temporal, spatial, social and hypothetical distance being considered most important, though there is some debate among social psychologists about further dimensions like informational, experiential or affective distance. 

An example of construal level effects would be that although planning one's next summer vacation one year in advance will evoke rather abstract thoughts about holidays (e.g., anticipating fun and relaxation), the very same vacation planned to occur very soon will evoke more concrete expectations (e.g. having a drink at the hotel pool, going for a trip in an off-road vehicle, having oysters at a restaurant).
