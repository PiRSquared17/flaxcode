The Dark Triad is a group of three personality traits: narcissism, Machiavellianism and psychopathy, all of which are interpersonally aversive. The Dark Triad refers to three theoretically distinct but empirically overlapping personality constructs. The term reflects the perception that these three diagnostic categories, have at least some common underlying factors:

*The narcissistic personality (in the clinical sense) is characterized by a grandiose self-view, a sense of entitlement, lack of empathy, and egotism. On some theories, such as Kohut, it is associated with protection of a radically weak, shamed, or damaged self.

*The Machiavellian personality is characterized by manipulation and exploitation of others, with a cynical disregard for morality and a focus on self-interest and deception.

*The psychopath, or antisocial personality, is characterized by impulsive thrill-seeking, and in its "primary" form by selfishness, callousness, lack of personal affect, superficial charm, and remorselessness.

All three characters involve a callous-manipulative interpersonal style, and are considered aversive. Jakobwitz and Egan carried out a factor analysis and found "agreeableness" strongly dissociated with all dark triad personality types, but other factors (neuroticism, lack of conscientiousness) were associated only with some members of the triad.

== An evolutionary account of the Dark Triad ==

Most work on the Dark Triad points to correlations with aggression, racism, and bullying. for evidence of the aversive nature of these traits.

In general, most researchers treat these traits as pathological, something that needs to be treated, and inherently bad. However, some argue that this view of the traits is the result of researchers having an implicit group selection orientation towards personality traits. Group selection is an antiquated and generally rejected idea in evolutionary biology that argues that organisms do what is best for the group/species. 

Modern evolutionary biology, instead takes what is called the selfish gene approach made famous by Richard Dawkins. This does not imbue agency in the organism but, instead, simply argues that individual agents are motivated to produce more copies of themselves. This means that even apparently aversive acts and attitudes can have beneficial outcomes for the individual even if they are costly or undesirable to the group.

==== As mating strategy ====
Moreover, the time-course of the benefits are an important consideration. These traits appear to predispose individuals to short-term rewards and relationships over long-term rewards and benefits. Although advanced societies attempt to promote long-term thinking (environmental protection, saving money for retirement), there are reproductive benefits for the individual for thinking and acting on a shorter time-course.

Consistent with this perspective, those high on the Dark Triad tend to have an accelerated mating strategy, reporting more sex partners, more favorable attitudes towards casual sex, lowered standards in their short-term mates, a tendency to steal or poach mates from others, more risk-taking in the form of substance abuse, a tendency to prefer immediate but smaller amounts of money over larger but delayed amounts of money, limited self control and ADHD symptoms and a pragmatic and game-playing love style. These traits have been identified as part of a fast life strategy that appears to be enacted by an exploitative, opportunistic, and protean approach to life in general and at work.

This is not to say these traits do not come with side effects nor is this a condonement of their aggressive and selfish interpersonal style but one must take a less biased view of all personality traits, even those we do not like, to provide more complete theoretical models of their development, their role in people's lives, and to even hope to change them. Moreover, this perspective is grounded in a strong and robust theoretical paradigm known as Life History Theory which itself based on Evolutionary Theory, which is a major theoretical advance in understanding personality variation relative to traditional personality research which tends to be agnostic about theories (but not hypotheses) and can account for the heritable nature of these traits.
