In social psychology, social salience is a set of reasons which draw an observer's attention toward a particular object.

The reasons for this effect can be:
# General object attributes - vivid colors, stands right in front of observer etc
# Difference between object attribute and its immediate environment.
# Gap between observer's expectations and observable attribute.
# Observer's goal - You are likely to focus on the object that you are looking for.
