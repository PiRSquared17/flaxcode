Distraction-conflict (also distraction/conflict) is a term used in social psychology. The distraction-conflict model states that "in the presence of others there is a conflict between attending to the person and attending to the task". It has been argued that the distraction-attention theory suggests that "distraction during a simple task will improve performance if it triggers attentional conflict". One question surrounding this theory was what the actual source of distraction was when in the presence of another person. In 1978, Sanders, Baron and Moore argued that distraction could occur if "subjects wanted to get social comparison information from the other person. In an experiment, they set up a copying task in three different conditions: alone, with someone else doing the same task, and with someone else doing a different task, and hypothesized that only in the case where the other person present was doing the same task would social comparison, and therefore distraction, be occurring. The effects of distraction-conflict are shown to be the strongest when there is a sense of urgency. Distraction-conflict, as well as social uncertainty and self-attention, may "provoke resource overload because they absorb attentional capacity". Distraction-conflict has been supported by several studies which have produced results showing that "distractions, such as noise or flashing lights, have the same drivelike effects on task performance that audiences do". This is because "our attention is divided between the task at hand and observing the reactions of the people in the audience" in much the same way how one is distracted from the task at hand by sounds or flashing lights.
