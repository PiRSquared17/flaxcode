Sociometer theory is a theory of self-esteem from an evolutionary psychological perspective that proposes that state self-esteem is a gauge (or sociometer) of interpersonal relationships. This theoretical perspective was first introduced by Mark Leary and colleagues in 1995 and later expanded on by Kirkpatrick and Ellis.
