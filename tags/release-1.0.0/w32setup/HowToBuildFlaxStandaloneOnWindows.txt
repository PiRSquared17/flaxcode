-- Creating the build environment --

1. Make a folder for Flax, say c:\Flax
2. Check out the Flax sources to this folder 
3. Install Python 2.5.1 (to the default folder, C:\Python25) and add this folder to your Path (Control Panel, System, Advanced, Environment  Variables) [NOT Python 2.5, we have found at least one situation where this matters]
4. Install a recent Perl (say 5.8.8 from Active State at http://www.activestate.com/Products/activeperl/) - make a note of the Path to this for config.mak later.
5.a. Install Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition from http://www.microsoft.com/express/2005/
5.b. Install the Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows 2003 Server R2 from http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=0baf2b35-c656-4969-ace8-e4c0c0716adb&displaylang=en
6. a. Download the Visual C redistributable files from http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=32BC1BEE-A3F9-4C13-9C99-220B62A191EE&displaylang=en
and copy into the same folder as this text file.
b. Download the Windows Installer 3.0 update (WindowsInstaller-KB884016-v2-x86.exe) from http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=5FBC5470-B259-4733-A914-A956122E08E8&displaylang=en
and copy into the same folder as this text file.
7.a. Install pywin32 for Python 2.5
  b. Install py2exe for Python 2.5
        HACK: py2exe currently needs patching:
        http://www.selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial-devel/2006-November/000353.html
8. Install InnoSetup and add its folder to your Path
9. Install Zlib from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/downlinks/zlib.php, choosing a path of \GnuWin32. Extract zlib1.dll from the /bin folder and put it in the same folder as this text file. 
Make a note of the path for putting into config.mak later. You'll also have to patch Zlib as follows: find the file include/zconf.h 
in the Zlib installation folder and change line 289 to:
#  include <safeunistd.h> 
9a. Install libiconv from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/downlinks/libiconv.php and install to \GnuWin32  and add the folder to /bin to your Path (i.e. C:\GnuWin32\bin). Copy libiconv.dll from this folder to the same folder as this text file.
10. Install SVN (download and unzip the Windows binary ' svn-win32-1.4.5.zip' from http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=91 and add the folder to /bin to your Path (i.e. c:\work\svn-win32-1.4.5\bin)
11. To make sure Python (and in particular the Processing module installation files) can find the Visual C++ compiler, find C:\Python25\lib\distutils\msvccompiler.py and modify line 129 to read:
self.set_macro("FrameworkSDKDir", net, "sdkinstallrootv2.0")
12. Get some missing runtime libraries:
a. Run vcredist_x86.exe 
b. Copy msvcr80.dll from C:\WINDOWS\WinSxS\x86_Microsoft.VC80.CRT_1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b_8.0.50727.42_x-ww_0de06acd to C:\Windows, otherwise distutils can't find it.
c. Download msvcp71.dll from http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?msvcp71 - this is something Py2exe needs - unzip into the same folder as this text file.

-- Building Xapian & Flax --

11. To build Xapian and the other Flax dependencies:
a. cd to ..\libs\xappy\libs and run 'python get_xapian.py' to obtain the correct version of Xapian.
b. modify xapian-core\win32\config.mak to match your system (Python path, Perl path, Zlib path)
c. modify xapian-core\win32\win32_bindings_python.mak to comment out lines 70-77 (the block that starts with 'modern/xapian_wrap.cc...'
TEMP: change the first line of win32msvc\version.rc.python to
#include "winresrc.h"
d. run the batch file 'buildalldeps' 
     
12. To build Flax only, run the batch file 'buildflaxonly'
13. The packaged, standalone Flax should be in the package/ subfolder
