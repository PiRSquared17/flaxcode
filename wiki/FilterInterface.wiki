#summary This document describes how Flax extracts text from documents.

= Introduction =

Flax must extract text from documents in order to feed it to
Xapian. Since it is hard to know all the document formats that people
might want to be able to search we want to allow for new parsers for
given document formats to be installed with the minimum of difficulty.

= Filters = 

Xapian (the search engine underlying Flax) has a notion of "fields"
for documents. Fields can be used to enhance searches by specifying
the fields within which we wish to search, or by attaching extra
significance to terms found in particular fields.

A document filter takes a filename (in future version this will be
generalised to a URI) and returns an iterator that yields `(fieldname, text)` pairs. 
Where `fieldname` names the field to which the `text`
is to be added. Each such pair is referred to as a "block" for
`fieldname`.

Both `fieldname` and `text` can be any string, however for a filter to
make the most of the Flax infrastructure it should be implemented with
the points below in mind.

== Fields ==

Flax only takes note of a certain predefined fields, as mentioned
below. Filters may emit blocks for other fields, but blocks for such
fields will be treated as if they were `content` blocks. Future
releases of Flax will provide an infrastructure for defining the
treatment of arbitrary field blocks.

Flax does little checking of the blocks returned by filters, and will
tolerate significant deviation from the guidelines below (checking
would slow down the indexing process), but if filters do not follow
these guidelines then the quality of search results might be
lessened. The filters that are distributed as part of Flax all comply
with these guidelines.

The fields that Flax notices are as follows:

  * `title`: The document title. Ideally there should be exactly one
    block for this field. If there is no block for this then Flax will
    provide a default block based on either the filename, uri or
    initial block emitted by the filter.

  * `keyword`: A keyword for the document. The content for each block
     should be a single word.

  * `content`: Text for the main contents of the document. `content`
    blocks should be emitted in paragraphs. Phrase and adjacency
    searches take note of paragraphs. For example, if a filter emits
    blocks: `('content', 'Aardvark ')` followed by `('content', 'soup')`, 
    then a search for the phrase `"Aardvark soup"` will
    fail. However if a filter emits `('content', 'Aardvark soup')`
    then the same search will succeed.

  * `description`: The document's description. Filters may emit
    several blocks for this field. Text should be emitted in
    paragraphs.

Note that the flax infrastructure uses the following fields. Filters
should not emit blocks for these:

  * `filename`: The operating system filename for the file.  

  * `uri`: uri for the file (not currently used, but reserved for
    future use).

== Simplicity considerations ==

For version 1.0 of Flax a relatively simple filter interface is
defined.  In the future a mechanism for defining the treatment of
blocks for other fields will be provided. The issue is essentially one
of determining what the appropriate Xapian field actions for each
field, and providing user interface components to interact with fields
that are not known in advance.

== Efficiency considerations ==

We could code to enforce the guidelines, but this adds a burden both to
the Flax infrastructure and to the authors of filters.

Implementing filters as iterators allows for reasonable memory use for
large files - there is no need for filter implementations to hold all
of a file in memory, and there is no need for Flax or Xapian to hold
more than a block at a time in memory.
