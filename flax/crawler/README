flax.crawler
============

Works with Python 2.6

The module crawler.py is a web crawling engine including an in-memory
implementation of the data abstraction classes.

The module sql_crawler.py is an SQL database reference implementation of the
data abstraction classes.

The directory 'test' contains a web site used in the test for crawler.py (see
the source). For the test to work, a virtual host should be set up on localhost
so that the URL http://test/ maps to the 'test' directory.
